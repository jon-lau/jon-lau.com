# nathan-lam.com
Personal/portfolio website built using Jekyll, Semantic UI, and hosted through Github pages. This repository hosts my [personal website](http://www.nathan-lam.com/), feel free to browse it!

# Developers Guide 
* To work on the website, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) must be installed on your machine. 
* Create a directory to hold the project
* Clone the project to your machine with:
```
git clone https://github.com/nathancy/nathan-lam.com.git
```
* cd into the directory and build the website with:
```
jekyll build
```
* Run the application locally with:
```
jekyll serve --watch
```
* The local website can then be accessed at localhost:4000 from any browser. The production website is built off of the master branch and pushing to master automatically updates the production website. 

Note: It may take some time to build the project and start up the application after running the commands.
